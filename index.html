                        They donated their first production of 5000 masks to GYWS for their distribution in the Kharagpur region. <br><br>

                        These 7 areas were chosen after proper analysis and survey due to the following major reasons:

                            <li>To reach a vast area of almost 30 square km in West Medinipore.</li>

                            <li>Accountability can be traced back.</li>
                            <li>MNREGA 100 day workers to be reached who are really needy and cannot buy the mask.</li>
                            <li>It's better than distribution through clubs and volunteers,.where reach will be much lower and risky.</li>

                        The distribution was carried out in two phases distributing food to 225 families in each phase. Phase one distribution was done on May 19th to 22. The second phase distribution was done from 7th June to 9th June. <br><br>
                        A month’s ration for a family of 4 was distributed to 450 families, covering a total of 1981 people. The beneficiaries included BPL, APL families, and the ones who didn’t have ration cards and thus were unable to access the food provided by the government. <br><br>
                        To ensure that the help is provided to the right section and to prepare the list to beneficiaries, we conducted proper surveys with the help of local volunteers and had made NOC signed from the pradhans of the gram panchayats.
